# My e-mail verification code does not work

If the link from the verification mail does not work when you click on it, you can copy the link by right-clicking on it and pasting it into a new private window. Then the link should work.

If the link has expired, you can simply send a new verification mail after logging in.


If you're still facing the issue, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at [contact@yacht.chat](mailto:contact@yacht.chat).
