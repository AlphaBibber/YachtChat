# I can not use other videoconferencing software while using Yacht.Chat

## What is the reason for this issue?
Sometimes using Yacht.Chat in the background can lead to interference with other video
conferencing tools â€“ especially on Microsoft Windows.

## Solution

To avoid this we recommend installing virtual camera software. <br/>
Alternatively, you can also let us automatically disable your camera
when Yacht.Chat enters the background.

You can change this in your settings.
