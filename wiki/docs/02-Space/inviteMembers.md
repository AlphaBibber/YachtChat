# Invite Users

To get the most out of Yacht.Chat we recommend testing it with other users, to get a better feeling of how to collaborate in Yacht.Chat.

If you created a space you can easily invite users by copying the shown link and sending it to your colleges.

You can send the link via e-mail or any other service to your colleges. 

An advantage is that you only have to send it once and use the space for an infinite time

It is possible to invite Users at a later stage as well. Just click on INVITE LINK in the top left corner in space or click on INVITE next to the space name at the overview of the spaces.
