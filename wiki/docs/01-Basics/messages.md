# Messages

On Yacht.Chat you can also send messages. We gave you the possibility to send messages to share links with your colleagues.
If you are in the range of a user you can receive the messages she/he sends. If she/he sends a message, you get a notification and you can see the old messages of a user if you hover over her/him.
