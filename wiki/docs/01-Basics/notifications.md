# Notifications

You can turn off the notifications in the settings of Yacht.Chat.
If the notifications are turned on you will receive them if a user enters your speaking range or sends you a message if your browser tab is not active.

You can click on the notification to get directly into your Yacht.Chat browser tab.

To receive the notification sometimes you have to additionally turn on the notification of your browser.

For example, the image shows how you can turn on the notification on your mac for chrome.
