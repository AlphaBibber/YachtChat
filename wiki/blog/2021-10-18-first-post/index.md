Shaping the future of remote collaboration!

Yacht.chat is a digital communication platform that enables real-time #collaboration for #remoteworking teams. 👩‍💻

Unlike existing communication solutions, Yacht allows each team member to move around freely in a virtual space and adjust their speaking radius. Conversations can thus easily emerge and adapt to team dynamics - comparable to working in an office. Yacht combines the collaborative working methods of an #office with the advantages of #remotework. 💡
