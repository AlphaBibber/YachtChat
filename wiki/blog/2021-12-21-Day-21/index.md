🎅Day 21/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Feedback and help from others is crucial in founding your own company so today we want to say Thank You! 💕

Thank you Carolin Bock for the great "Start Up Community Darmstadt – Gründung und Management eines Startups" seminar. During the seminar, we had the opportunity to work on our idea and especially on our pitch with experienced entrepreneurs and investors. Due to the many feedbacks, we were able to create a pitch with which we could approach first potential investors and customers 🗣

Thanks to the VentureLab team for your consulting services and the important feedback during our first videos as well as the general support of our idea like in the Red Bull Basement challenge 🙏🏼

Thanks to the Hessen Ideen team and especially to Katja Walther for managing the scholarship. Whenever there were failures or the motivation was a bit low, you provided us with ideas and good humor to keep going. Furthermore, we were able to learn a lot from you, the workshops and founder talks during the last months 💡

Thank you to the HIGHEST – Innovations- und Gründungszentrum team and especially Simone Eva Maria Lühl and Gudrun Lantelme for the guidance through this exciting time of founding a company, the constant feedback and all the help on any problems we had 🙏🏼

Thanks to Lisa Schebitz and UnternehmerTUM for the opportunity to regularly exchange ideas with other founders within the "Hack'n'talk" series and all the other talks, events and offers you provide. Thanks to Chris Eberl for the countless inputs you gave us in UnternehmerTUM's Business Plan Advanced Seminar and especially for teaching us entrepreneurial thinking 💪🏼


❗️Stay tuned for day 22. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗️
