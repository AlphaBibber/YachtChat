🎅Day 19/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Today we present you our roadmap to show you where we are coming from and where we want to go. 🗺

It all started with the idea of a flexible collaboration tool in November 2020.💡

At the end of 2020, we started to apply only with the idea for the TU Darmstadt Idea competition and got rejected.😕

That did not stop us from starting with an extreme programming session in March 2021. We wanted to see how hard it would be to develop such a tool.👨‍💻

On the way home from Munich, the Darmstadt team received confirmation of the previously selected seminar. Through this seminar, we were able to gain important experience in founding a start-up.👥

So we applied for the Hessen Ideen Stipendium and got in. With the Hessen Ideen Stipendium, we are supported for 6 months.🎉

We also applied again for the TU Darmstadt Idea competition and this time we got into the second round.😕

Additionally, we applied again for the Xplore Program at the TU Munich and waiting for the result.⏳

At the beginning of 2022, we want to apply for an EXIST founder scholarship and get a monthly userbase to develop new features.👀

The biggest goal in 2022 is to get the first financing for Yacht.Chat.💸

❗️Stay tuned for day twenty. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗️
