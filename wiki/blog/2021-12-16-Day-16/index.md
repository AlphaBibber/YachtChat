🎅Day 16/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Today we will explain the meaning behind our name and our logo.

Yacht stands for:

**Y**et

**A**nother

**CH**at

**T**ool

The name is with a bit of self-irony and should express the joy Yacht should bring back into the remote work.

The logo adapts to the circle theme, which is an integral part of our corporate design. On the logo itself you can see a yacht. The yacht is driven by a chat box as a sail, which represents the verbal exchange. So here we take up the irony of the name, combine it with the core theme of our product and wrap it up in an appealing design.

❗️Stay tuned for day seventeen. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗️
