🎅Day 23/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Yacht.Chat's MVP has already been online for a few weeks. We will still make adjustments to our Design and fix some minor bugs this year. But for the next year, we have already planned new features that our users would like to see 💡

In addition to increasing the number of users in a Space, we will introduce other features that facilitate collaboration. This includes easy document exchanges, a shared whiteboard and shared notes for productive brainstorming sessions and much more 👩🏼‍💻🧑🏼‍💻

With the new design of the app, the background of the spaces should also be customizable by users over time. Show your brand identity in Yacht.Chat!

We also know that the integration of different programs is essential for effective remote work. For this reason, next year we will also begin to integrate the most used work programs, such as Slack, into Yacht.Chat 🗂

❗️Since tomorrow is Christmas Eve and therefore our Christmas countdown ends we will announce the winner of our contest tomorrow - Stay tuned❗️
