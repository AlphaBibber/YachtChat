🎅Day 3/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Today we will introduce you to the development team of Yacht.Chat 🎉

Danilo is responsible for our DevOps, meaning he is the guy to blame if Yacht.Chat is not running.🥵

Marc is mainly doing our backend and thinks about scaling our application to billions of users since we had ten.👥

Tristan works on our frontend and makes Yacht.Chat look as sleek as it does.💫

There you have it, this is our Dev Team👾

❗️Stay tuned for day four. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗️
