🎅Day 22/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

If you’ve ever used Yacht.Chat and invited another person to a Space, you’ve probably noticed that the invitation process is not always straightforward. 😅Given that most of new users coming to Yacht.Chat are in fact invited by someone else, we decided that we need to improve the invite-flow and some other things for our users. Our goal here is to make each task a user has to perform as intuitive and as simple as possible. 🧐

Today we would like to give you a preview of the changes coming to Yacht.Chat soon. 🤓 Would you agree that these changes are indeed an improvement?

❗️Stay tuned for day 23. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗️
