🎅🏼Day 8/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Today, we will talk about our technical infrastructure. Yacht.Chat is a video conferencing application that uses peer-to-peer connections. Now you might ask yourself either: What does this even mean?

❗Stay tuned for day nine. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗
