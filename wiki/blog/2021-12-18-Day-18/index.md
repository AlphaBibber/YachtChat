🎅Day 18/24 of our Christmas countdown 🎄

Today we will talk about the most important asset a start up can have: customers.
To find our customers we have formulated the following three hypotheses:

Standard Videoconferencing Tools are just means of information exchange.

Working remotely makes employees feel more isolated from the team.

Today, the tools to quickly interact with remote working colleagues are not sufficient.

We approach early adopters from a wide range of industries with these hypotheses and validate them in an initial conversation. By evaluating the interviews, conclusions can be drawn about a possible product-market fit in this industry. Once the target market has been identified, only companies in this industry are approached in order to better understand their remote work pains.

Which hypothesis would you answer in the affirmative?
Which one would you deny?

❗️Stay tuned for day nineteen. We will post every day something for you until Christmas❗️
