            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            <p>

                anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website

            <h3>Consent-Management-Tool</h3>

            <p>
                We use the consent management
                service Posthog of PostHog Inc, 2261 Market Street Unit 4008 San Francisco, CA
                94114 United States on our website. In this context, the date and time of the
                visit, browser information, consent information, device information and the IP
                address of the requesting device are processed. Obtaining and managing legally
                required consents is to be considered a legitimate interest in the sense of the
                aforementioned provision, as the interference with the rights of users as a
                result of the use of anonymized IP addresses and the involvement of a self-hosted
                service is very low. PostHog does not store any data, instead, consents
                and revocations are stored by Yacht.chat. The legal basis is our legitimate
                interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1. lit. f DSGVO. Being able to comply
                with the accountability obligation pursuant to Art. 5 (2) DSGVO is a legitimate
                interest too.

            </p>

            <p>
                With the deployed tracking
                measures we want to ensure an appropriate design and continuous optimization of
                our website. On the other hand, we use tracking measures to compile statistics
                on the use of our website and to evaluate the optimization of our offerings for
                you.
            </p>

            <p>
                These interests are to be
                considered as justified within the meaning of the aforementioned regulation.
            </p>

            <p>
